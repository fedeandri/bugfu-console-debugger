**HOW TO OPEN YOUR BROWSER JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE**

If you've never used the JavaScript Console before, here's how you open it:

* Chrome PC shift+ctrl+j - Chrome Mac alt+cmd+j
* Firefox PC shift+ctrl+k - Firefox Mac alt+cmd+k
* Safari PC shift+ctrl+c - Safari Mac alt+cmd+c

**HOW TO USE BUGFU WITH WORDPRESS**

Call the log static method from wherever you are within the WordPress PHP code
`
<?php /* WORDPRESS CODE HERE */

/* Call it with no arguments to only output some backtrace info */
BugFu::log();

/* Call it with a string argument to output that string content */
BugFu::log($my_string_content);

/* Call it with a non-string argument to output the structured
   representation of that argument - it uses var_export() */
BugFu::log($my_object-array-variable);

/* Call it it with the second optional argument set to "false"
   to turn off the backtrace info (which is on by default) */
BugFu::log($my_content, false);
`
